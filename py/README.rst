PyIrToy
=======

A python module for transmitting and receiving infrared signals from an IR Toy.
This requires the Dangerous Prototype USB IR Toy 
(http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_Infrared_Toy) with firmware revision 21
or higher.

This module has been tested with Python 3.  There is no OS specific code in this
module, so it should work on Mac OS and Windows but has not been tested.
